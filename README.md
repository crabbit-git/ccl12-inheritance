# What's this then?

This is the 12th "lab" exercise assigned by a software development course I'm doing at the moment. The point of this one was to familiarise us with inheritance in Python.

# What does it actually do?

It isn't really an application or anything, just a collection of class definitions which involve inheritence of attributes and functions from superclasses. I don't think it was actually intended as part of the exercise, but given that we'd been using unit testing to validate functions/classes for a bunch of other recent exercises, that's what I did here: the `tests` package contains test modules and the `classes` package contains the actual class definitions themselves. You can run `run_tests.py` from the terminal to run every test for every class regardless of its position in the hierarchy.
