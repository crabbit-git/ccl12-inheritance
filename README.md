# What's this then?

This is the 12th "lab" exercise assigned by a software development course I'm doing at the moment. The point of this one was to familiarise us with inheritance in Python. You can see the instructions we were given in `task.md`.

# What does it actually do?

It isn't really an application or anything, just a collection of class definitions which involve inheritence of attributes and functions from superclasses. I initially structured this as a bunch of unit tests and class modules because we've been doing that a lot lately and I figured that was probably what was wanted here as well, but the instructions actually specify that we've just to use print statements instead, so I restructured it to do that.
